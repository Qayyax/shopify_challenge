 - I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 - I did not use any libraries or framework.

# What blockers did I have?

- It was my first time working with SVG, it took me a little while to understand how it worked.

- I plan to work on projects that make API calls to databases, and I get to display the results on the frontend

- I plan to learn more animations and functionality.
